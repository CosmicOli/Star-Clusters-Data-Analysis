# Star-Clusters-Data-Analysis
Code used to fit star cluster data to the main sequence line as part of the UoB module Physics Laboratory 1 Astrolab.

Both NGC2516.csv and NGC3201.csv contains the B-V Colour Index and the Apparent Visual Magnitude of stars in their clusters.

The code is in 3 sections.

Section 1: Plots the 2 clusters on the HR diagram using the sigma method of fitting data to a line. This method involves minimising a sum of distances that each point has from the main sequence line.

Section 2: Plots the clusters on the HR diagram and highlights the different regions which show different star types.

Section 3: Plots the 2 clusters on the HR diagram using the points in range method of fitting data to a line. This method involves removing outliers to fit only the main sequence part of the cluster to the main sequence line.
